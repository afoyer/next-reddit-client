This is a work-in-progress Reddit client project using [`next-auth`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth), [`snoowrap`](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap) and [`next.js`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/).

## A bit of information

[`next-auth`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) now supports reddit auth using the canary branch. Make sure to use: 

`
npm i next-auth@canary
`


Don't forget to also set your client and secret key somewhere safe.

This is still an early test and only shows top posts of a particular subreddit so we'll see where this goes.
